## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in
`lib/rcpdflayout/constants.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which
will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag,
and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
